<p>This is a paragraph of text. Some of the text may be <em>emphasised</em> and some it might even be <strong>strongly emphasised</strong>. Occasionally <q>quoted text</q> may be found within a paragraph &hellip;and of course <a href="#">a link</a> may appear at any point in the text. The average paragraph contains five or six sentences although some may contain as little or one or two while others carry on for anything up to ten sentences and beyond.</p>
<p>Paragraphs rarely hang out by themselves. And the space between each paragraph is pretty important to look at and set to a nice amount. Some paragraphs indent the first line, and it's also nice to see what that will look like. Sometimes only the first paragraph has that indented line. Or sometimes every paragraph except the first one is indented. That's more common really. Now I'm just rambling, you know, to make this paragraph longer. I don't want to go get lorum ipsum text, but I bet I'm about to do exactly that. I don't want these paragraphs to be too short. Usually the paragraphs of finished content will be on the longer side, while 'fake' content used in design comps is on the shorter side, causing serious problems when the real-world content shows up. </p>
<p>In fact, there are a lot of things some 'designers' do in their design comps that drive me nuts. Especially when they are using Photoshop to draw a picture of a web page. It's easier in Photoshop to magically make all content the same length. As if all sentences have exactly the same number of words, as if all headlines are the same length and not too long. Then when the real website is built things don't magically line up as perfectly the same. And then what? There's no information about how the design is suppost to adapt. In fact, usually the designer hasn't thought about that at all. They are pretending the web is print design. And it's not. That's one of many reasons why I'd rather design in real HTML and CSS. Then you can see how the fonts really look, and we can plan for content of different lengths. For real. On the real web. Oh look, I've rambled long enough that I don't need lorum ipsum. Hooray!</p>
